## Research

the first part of my process for constructing my plotter was to do a bunch of background research on what other people have done for their own diy plotter projects.
| Project | Notes |
|---|---|
| [3 Axis Cnc Plotter From Dc Motors And Optical Encoders](https://www.instructables.com/3-AXIS-CNC-PLOTTER-FROM-DC-MOTORS-AND-OPTICAL-ENCO/) | This project interested me at first because of its use of repurposed printer parts. It was important for me to create a project that interrogated the disposability politics of modern technology, questioning both print media and digital media, and using repurposed parts of machines past their prime felt like a good way of doing that. In the end, I decided that I wanted to make something a little more polished, and make use of systems that are simpler to maintain, in service of the longevity of my project |  
| [Plottybot](https://ben.akrin.com/plottybot/) | I was originally planning to go with this plotter, because it is very well documented, but i decided to switch because it does not fit within a frame, and I wanted to have my plotter be easily encloseable, for convenience and safety in the exhibit setting | 
| [The $50 Pen Plotter](https://hackaday.com/2023/03/19/the-50-pen-plotter/) | This project does an admirable job of keeping costs low. It would be a really good reference to look to if i wanted to explore how to make my project more accessible and replicable. In the end, I decided that it was more important to me to ensure the machine was robust reliable, than making sure it was low cost. | 
| [Scalable Pen Plotter - As big as you need it!](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3789969) | This plotter is a great example of a diy machine that uses paper movement as one of the axes. This makes the kinematics of the CNC system somewhat simpler, but it adds a lot more complexity in terms of ensuring that the movement of the paper is reliable. This machine, like others of its kind, uses rubber rollers to move the paper, and the added concern of making sure that my plotter would create  |

This was an essential part of figuring out my greater project, because from this research, I decided that I needed my plotter to be fast, and that I wanted it to be contained inside a frame. After making these decisions, i was able to rule out some projects that didnt fit these parameters. Eventually, I decided to base my project around James Carruther's [PlotterXY](https://github.com/jamescarruthers/PlotterXY), mainly because it used the CoreXY kinematic system that I had decided would be best for my project.
