## Research
the first part of my process for constructing my plotter was to do a bunch of background research on what other people have done for their own diy plotter projects.

| [3 Axis Cnc Plotter From Dc Motors And Optical Encoders](https://www.instructables.com/3-AXIS-CNC-PLOTTER-FROM-DC-MOTORS-AND-OPTICAL-ENCO/) | This project interested me at first because of its use of repurposed printer parts. It was important for me to create a project that interrogated the disposability politics of modern technology, questioning both print media and digital media, and using repurposed parts of machines past their prime felt like a good way of doing that. In the end, I decided that I wanted to make something a little more polished, and make use of systems that are simpler to maintain, in service of the longevity of my project |

This was an essential part of figuring out my greater project, because from this research, I decided that I needed my plotter to be fast, and that I wanted it to be contained inside a frame. After making these decisions, i was able to rule out some projects that didnt fit these parameters. Eventually, I decided to base my project around James Carruther's [PlotterXY](https://github.com/jamescarruthers/PlotterXY), mainly because it used the CoreXY kinematic system that I had decided would be best for my project.
