## Project Description

*In 1-3 paragraphs, describe your project in as much detail as you can, using as simple and direct language as possible. Avoid jargon. Some questions to consider: What are your main questions/influences? What ideas ground your research? What form does the project take? Why is the work urgent, necessary, relevant today? Who is the ideal audience / what community is the project most accountable to? **Also include the rough scale and size that you have in mind.** This will help think about how the projects will come together in the show.*

It feels important to me to begin any explanation of this project with a contextualization within my larger interest in the relationship between print and digital media. I think that there is untapped potential between these modalities of media, and part of the motivation behind this project is to increase awareness of the particularities of each, in the hope that we can collaboratively unlock more. maybe thats super pretentious but it wouldnt really be my project if there wasnt some sort of aspect about educating people about something.

My aunt is an archivist/librarian. She currently works at the Bancroft Library (UCB), but before that, she worked at the GLBT Historical Society Archives in San Francisco. I remember her talking about how the archive was interested in collecting any ephemera relating to queerness in san francisco, from flyers handed out at demonstrations, to educational pamphlets given out during pride. This was an important moment for me, because I realized that all this information i took for granted or threw out was valuable. It was an important part of ensuring future understanding of the current state of the world. Thankfully for my future roomates and my parent's basement, i didnt take this to mean that I had to keep little piece of printed paper that crossed through my hands, but I did begin to appreciate the quotidian information we take for granted more.

Later, I began to realize that the internet functioned in the same way

The general idea is to create a program that enables us to archive the web in a physical and personal way. I have long thought that zines are a beautifully human way of conveying information, so I decided to use that form for this project. My goal is to create a system that will take a webpage as input and will parse its central contents and then let the user organize the information, which then gets exported in a print ready form. The software should work with any output method, but for my project specifically, I chose to use a pen plotter. I think that the choice of a pen plotter fits into my idea well because it is an older form of printing technology which is somewhat simpler, and thereby more robust, than todays laser and inkjet printers. Using a plotter also aids in the perception of the zines a keepable object, because a plotter traces the paths of the content on a page in a manner tangibly similar to the way that we draw as humans, which makes it seem much more unique, and less disposable.

this project aims mainly to make people think about the ephemeral nature of internet media. I also offer a solution, although perhaps overly whimsical.

So far, I have been working on the plotter build, focusing on whatever comes up. It has been taking somewhat longer than I had anticipated.

Overall, I would like to

## Research Archive

I have been collecting sources pertaining to this project and my greater interest in the relationship between print and digital media in [this raindrop collection](https://raindrop.io/tacypw/print-digital-35667421)

Ive curated a selection of visual inspirations for this project in [this folder](Visual%20Archive/)
