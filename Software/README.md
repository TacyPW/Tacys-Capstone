My initial idea for the app that would power this project was to have it be a website that enables you to output a physical copy of another webpage in the form of a zine. It would follow this process:

1. The user is prompted to enter the URL of the webpage that they would like to archive
2. The app extracts the main content of the webpage
   - There would ideally be a function where the user is also able to self select the text from the website that they would like to include.
