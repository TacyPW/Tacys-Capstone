## user interaction

My initial idea for the app that would power this project was to have it be a website that enables you to output a physical copy of another webpage in the form of a zine. It would follow this process:

1. The user is prompted to enter the URL of the webpage that they would like to archive
2. The app extracts the main content of the webpage
   - There would ideally be a function where the user is also able to self select the text from the website that they would like to include.
3. The app autofills the text into a zine template (8 pages, 5.5 by 4.25) it is displayed as a series of pages (like in indesign) and users are given a small amount of editing options, like defining things as headings.
   - there should be a possibility for expanding the templates that are available, for example adding half letter folded zines and letter sized eight-fold minizines.
4. the zine template is reformatted into a one sheet svg canvas that can be output through the plotter or other printers.
   - perhaps there could be a small animation transition from one pane to the next to demonstrate the way that the pages are reorganized in the imposition.
5. For my capstone project, the last screen should let people send their creation to themself via email, and inform them that it will be added to the repository of visitor-generated zines that will be chosen from at the next demonstration of the system, and give the time of that next demo.

I am planning to flesh this out in a figma prototype to have something to show for myself for the midterm.

## Interface Design

The interface for the project should be inviting and lively. I want to
